		<description>We have updated our maps and geologic information for the Spraberry formation in the Midland Basin, which continues to be one of the most prolific areas for hydrocarbon production in the United States. The formation spans 16 counties in western Texas, which is the eastern part of the larger Permian Basin. In April 2022, daily average production from the Spraberry formation exceeded 1.3 million barrels of crude oil and 2.2 billion cubic feet of natural gas. We expect Spraberry production to continue to drive hydrocarbon production growth in the Permian Basin.</description>
